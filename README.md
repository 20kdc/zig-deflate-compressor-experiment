## Consider this severely unfinished

a zero-allocation DEFLATE compressor for Zig, in theory

TODO:

1. proper split between library and command
2. fix all the issues with the command
3. make it faster while keeping it zero-allocation

it's probably not going to support dynamic Huffman chunks anytime soon...
